Description: Optizyme uses a Gradient Descent algorithm to search for the optimal enzyme ratios for linear chain, cell-free pathways that conform to Michaelis Menten kinetics. Users should load a simulation of their pathway into their WD as "OFFunction" and provide kinetic constants in a matrix, vector, or csv file named "constants". This package includes a file of test values labeled "constants.csv".
